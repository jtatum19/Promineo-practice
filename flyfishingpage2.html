    <!---Below is a unordered list of some items that you can use to create flies-->
    <h2><em>Tying your own flies</em></h2>
        <p>Personally, I have never learned to tie my own flies many people enjoy it and they might even say they like it more than fishing.
            It has to be a great feeling knowing that you spent your time and effort tying the fly and being able to get a fish to bite it. 
            Maybe one day I will be able to experience it.  but for now, i will stick to exploring our great state of Idaho and all it has to offer.
            <ul><h4>Tying materials</h4>
                <li>Beads</li>
                <li>Feathers</li>
                <li>hair</li>
                <li>fur</li>
                <li>cones</li>
            </ul>
